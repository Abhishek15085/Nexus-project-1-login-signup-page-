1. Project nexus

Create a Project Directory:

Create a folder for your project. This will help keep all your files organized.
Inside this folder, create two subfolders: images for storing any images you might use (e.g., img.jpg for background) and css for storing your CSS file.
Files Organization:


Ensure you have the following files in the project directory:
index.html: Your HTML file.
css/style.css: Your CSS file.
images/img.jpg: Background image.
Linking CSS and Images:


Verify that the CSS file is correctly linked in the HTML file and that the background image path in the CSS file is correct.


2. HTML and CSS Code Review
HTML Code:

Ensure the HTML structure is correct, with proper tags and indentation.
Validate the HTML using a validator like W3C Validator to check for any errors or warnings.

CSS Code:

Check the CSS for proper syntax and indentation.
Validate the CSS using a validator like W3C CSS Validator to check for any errors or warnings.


3. Functionality and User Experience
Form Functionality:

Ensure the form fields are functional and properly styled.
Add basic form validation to check for empty fields.
Responsive Design:

Make sure the design is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Use media queries if necessary to adjust styles for different screen sizes.
Interactive Elements:

Ensure the checkbox, links, and buttons are interactive and have appropriate hover effects.
Test the “Remember me” checkbox and “Forgot password?” link to ensure they function or navigate as expected.



4. Styling and Design
Visual Design:

Ensure the color scheme is consistent and the text is readable against the background.
Verify the transparency and blur effects are properly applied to the form container.
Icons:

Check that the Boxicons are correctly displayed next to the input fields.
Typography:

Ensure the font-family is applied correctly and the text sizes are appropriate.


5. Final Touches
Cross-Browser Compatibility:

Test your page in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure it looks and works as expected.
Code Comments:

Add comments to your HTML and CSS files to explain sections of the code. This is helpful for anyone who might read or maintain your code in the future.
Clean Up:

Remove any unnecessary code or comments.
Ensure the code is neat and well-organized.


6. Submission Instructions
Project Documentation:

Create a README file explaining the project, how to set it up, and any other relevant information.
Include screenshots of your final design in the README file.
Zipping the Project:

Compress your project folder into a .zip file, including all the files and subfolders.
Submission:

Follow the submission instructions provided by your instructor or the platform where you need to submit the project. This could involve uploading the .zip file to a specific location or repository.
